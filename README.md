# Employee Satisfaction Survey Analysis

## Business Problem
A mid-sized IT company conducted an employee satisfaction survey to understand
the factors influencing employee engagement, stress, and overall job satisfaction.
The HR team aims to identify drivers of dissatisfaction and provide actionable
insights to improve retention and workplace culture.

## Objective
- Perform exploratory and descriptive analysis of employee survey data
- Identify patterns and correlations affecting job satisfaction
- Highlight departments and factors contributing to low satisfaction
- Provide actionable HR recommendations based on insights

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains employee-level survey responses covering:
- Demographics (age, gender, marital status, education)
- Job and organizational attributes (department, job level, experience)
- Work environment factors (workload, stress, sleep, commute)
- Training and team structure
- Self-reported job satisfaction (target variable)

## Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Univariate and bivariate analysis
- Department-wise satisfaction comparison
- Correlation analysis between stress, workload, and satisfaction
- Visualizations to support insights

## Key Insights
- High stress and workload strongly correlate with lower job satisfaction
- Work environment quality has a positive impact on employee morale
- Certain departments consistently show lower satisfaction levels
- Long commute distance and poor sleep patterns negatively affect satisfaction
- Training and development show a mild positive relationship with satisfaction

## HR Recommendations
- Introduce stress and workload management initiatives
- Improve work environment and flexibility where possible
- Conduct targeted interventions for low-satisfaction departments
- Promote remote or hybrid work options to reduce commute burden
- Increase training and career development opportunities

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Future Enhancements
- Attrition risk prediction modeling
- Job satisfaction prediction using ML
- Explainable AI techniques (SHAP) for insight transparency
